try this three by to matrix with the to the vector list
the to d vectors will get transform to a third dimension
the vectors line on this plane after transformation is the column space now let's combine the column of this matrix we will get another three d vector it can be found lying on the same color space let's add this to her matrix
now we get is the three by three matrices
and when it is multiplied with three d vectors lying on space it will squeeze all of them to the same column space
watch properly during transformation certain vectors got absorbed on the origin
and the list of vectors or the lines that goes to origin during transformation is the no space
they're coordinates can be obtained by solving this matrix equation
